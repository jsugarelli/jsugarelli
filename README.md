## About me

I am an economist, self-taught programmer, BI lead, author, and R enthusiast. I enjoy programming, writing and teaching. Focus of my work is on making complex things more accessible.

My GitHub presence features the R packages I have developed over the last couple of years. They broadly fall into the following categories:
* Statistical methods and teaching (packages [`quantification`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/quantification) and [`xplain`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/xplain))
* Data import and export (packages [`flatxml`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/flatxml), [`xml2relational`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/xml2relational), [`xmlconvert`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/xmlconvert))
* Working more efficiently with R (packages [`packagefinder`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/packagefinder) and [`debugr`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/debugr))
* Enhancing the R language (packages [`pointr`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/pointr) and [`switchcase`](https://github.com/jsugarelli/switchcase))

## My blog

I run the [Topics in R](https://topics-in-r.blogspot.de/) blog which I mainly use for announcements (new packages, articles, books) and which also feeds into [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). Here are the most recent posts (at least the major ones):

## Twitter

I try to keep away from social media (`Github != social_media`) to protect my time and be more productive, but I do use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsugarelli). If you want to  receive the latest updates on my packages and learn about interesting things I come across, click [@jsugarelli](https://twitter.com/jsugarelli) to follow.

## Current projects

* An introductory book to programming, explaining core concepts and introducing to Python and JavaScript (in German). Currently already in production at [Springer](https://www.springer.com/).
* *Step*: A simple, extendable, web-based programming language for beginners, written in PHP. With step-by-step exaplanation of program execution and support for multiple (natural) languages. Soon as a repo on GitHub.
* `shinyfilters`: An R package for filtering [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) widgets with multiple, interdependent filters. Soon as a repo on GitHub. 
* `typehint`: An R package for Python-like type hints for function arguments; arguments can also be validated automatically against the pre-defined data types. Soon as a repo on GitHub.


## Languages & Tools

### Languages

Mainly<br/>
[<img width="32px" alt="R" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/r/r.png" />](https://www.r-project.org)
[<img width="32px" alt="SQL" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/sql/sql.png" />](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-ver15)
<br/>but also from time to time<br/>
[<img width="32px" alt="JavaScript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/javascript/javascript.png" />](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
[<img width="32px" alt="Python" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" />](https://www.python.org/)
[<img width="32px" alt="PHP" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/ccc16358ac4530c6a69b1b80c7223cd2744dea83/topics/php/php.png" />](https://www.php.net/)
[<img width="32px" alt="Perl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/perl/perl.png" />](https://www.perl.org/)
[<img width="32px" alt="C/C++" src="https://isocpp.org/assets/images/cpp_logo.png" />](https://isocpp.org/)

Generally, I like to try out new (or old?) things (ever written something in FORTH?)

### Tools

For the tool freaks out there: My editor/IDE choice is quite language-dependent. I work mainly in R Studio (for R), Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (for T-SQL), Heidi (for MySQL), and DBeaver (for Postgres and everything else). I also use Sublime Text (mainly for JavaScript, Perl and PHP code) as well as PyCharm (for Python). To organize everything I work with Microsoft To Do and Microsoft OneNote (my second brain, absolutely indispensable). And most importantly for efficiency and avoidance of frictions: I use the same tools at home and in my job.
