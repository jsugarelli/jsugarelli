## About me

I am an economist, self-taught programmer, BI lead, author, and R enthusiast. I enjoy programming, writing and teaching. Focus of my work is on making complex things more accessible.

My GitHub presence features the R packages I have developed over the last couple of years. They broadly fall into the following categories:
* Statistical methods and teaching (packages `quantification` and `xplain`)
* Data import and export (packages `flatxml`, `xml2relational`, `xmlconvert`)
* Working more efficiently with R (packages `packagefinder` and `debugr`)
* Enhancing the R language (packages `pointr`and `switchcase`)

## On my blog

I run the [Topics in R](https://topics-in-r.blogspot.de/) blog which I mainly use for announcements (new packages, articles, books) and which also feeds into RBloggers. Here are the most recent posts:

## Twitter

I try to keep away from social media to protect my time and be more productive, but I do use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsugarelli). If you are interested in receiving the latest updates on my packages and interesting things I learned, follow [@jsugarelli](https://twitter.com/jsugarelli).
