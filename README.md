## About me

I am an economist, self-taught programmer, BI lead, author, and R enthusiast. I enjoy programming, writing and teaching. Focus of my work is on making complex things more accessible.

My GitHub presence features the R packages I have developed over the last couple of years. They broadly fall into the following categories:
* Statistical methods and teaching (packages `quantification` and `xplain`)
* Data import and export (packages `flatxml`, `xml2relational`, `xmlconvert`)
* Working more efficiently with R (packages `packagefinder` and `debugr`)
* Enhancing the R language (packages `pointr`and `switchcase`)
